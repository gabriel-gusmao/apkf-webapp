# apkf-webapp

This is a project, still in development, made to improve my skills. I´m working on a system based on the administration
of the kung fu association in which I am instructor, in Brazil. APKF (Associação Phoenix de Kung Fu) or (Phoenix Kung Fu 
Association) in English.
The "Belt" system of the association is a little different from the conventional color change. More pieces of clothing
changes during the progress of the member. So, these advances are called "phases". And some of the phases have levels.
For the login system, not yet implemented, the idea is to change the level of authorization with the exam approval. The
exam changes the member phase, based on the grade, and the new phase determines the authorization role.
Inside the system we have two levels of authorization. At the fifth phase we are considered instructors, and professors
at the eighth phase.
Instructors can teach, lead training groups. But only professors can evaluate exams.
